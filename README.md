Golo Language Development Tools (Eclipse)

<b>Manual installation</b>

Once you've cloned the repository, run mvn package.

This should produce two JAR, <i>org.gololang.gldt.core</i> and <i>org.gololang.gldt.core.ui</i> in their respective target directories.

Copy these two JARs in your Eclipse dropins folder and restart Eclipse.
